# Rx Webstreams 

**WARNING: HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL RIGHT NOW!**

A deno package by [@codemonument](https://github.com/codemonument) with RxJS like functionality, but for webstreams. 
It provides a lot of predefined sources, targets and especially transforms! 

Note, that the api is inspired by RxJS, but not related in any other way. 
This package is especially not based on RxJS!

## Parts 

- Sources: Predefined Readable Streams, like FileSource(), TimerSource(), and more 
- Transforms: Predefined Transport Streams, like map(), reduce(), and more 
- Targets: Predefined Writable Streams, like FileTarget(), UrlTarget(), and more


## Sources (planned)

- FileSource() 
- TimerSource()

## Transforms (planned)

- map() 
- reduce()

## Targets (planned)

- FileTarget() 
- UrlTarget() - too much work?
